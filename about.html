                    <h2>Meet Praveen</h2>
                    <p>Praveen Kumar, a former gym instructor who made a life-changing decision. He sacrificed his job,
                        livelihood, family assets, and savings to establish We Save Animals (WSA) Welfare Trust. Praveen
                        dedicates himself to providing care, nourishment, and a loving home to a diverse range of
                        animals. His shelter brings happiness and comfort to these animals in need.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="begining">
                    <h2>How <span>We Save Animals </span>started?</h2>
                    <p>In 2013, Praveen's journey began when he rescued a kitten with a spinal injury. Though it didn't
                        survive, the experience fueled his determination to help countless voiceless animals. He started
                        by rescuing and caring for injured animals at his home. As the number of rescues grew, he sought
                        temporary shelters to accommodate them. News of his compassion spread, and he found himself
                        attending to approximately 4-5 cases daily, tagged by people on social media platforms like
                        Facebook. With support from Dr. Girish of Blue Cross and Dr. Lohith of Maruthi Pet Clinic, he
                        established accounts to ensure timely medical attention for injured animals, irrespective of
                        financial constraints. As the rescues increased, so did the clinic bills, but Praveen remained
                        undeterred. His reputation extended beyond South Bangalore, receiving calls for help from areas
                        like Mysore, Mandya, Chikmagalur, and Hosur. To streamline operations, Praveen formed a WhatsApp
                        group with just six people and dedicated himself full-time to these cases. Despite financial
                        challenges and leaving his job, Praveen persisted with unwavering support from his family,
                        determined to do whatever he could for the animals.</p>

                        <h2>Pikachu</h2>
                        <p>My name is Pikachu, and I once roamed the streets with a broken spine and legs. Initially,
                            the treatments I received didn't bring me much relief, but then I was discovered by the
                            compassionate souls at We Save Animals. They showered me with love and care, taking me to
                            their shelter and later to a special home for treatment. They called me Pikachu, and with
                            their dedicated efforts, I underwent laser treatment and received meticulous monitoring.
                            Nourishing food was always at my disposal, and I even made some furry friends along the way.
                            As the days passed, I felt a remarkable improvement, and soon my legs began to support me
                            again. Today, I am fully healed and forever grateful to We Save Animals for their unwavering
                            support. I can now climb, go downstairs, run, play, jump, and even engage in joyful doggy
                            antics, just like any other furry companion. My transformation is a testament to the
                            incredible impact of We Save Animals, and I am forever indebted to their compassion and
                            care.</p>

                            Trust me, you never want to experience the agony of a severe skin infection. My skin felt
                            like it was on fire, and it was unbearable. But then, something wonderful happened. I was
                            taken in by the incredible team at WSA, the We Save Animals organization. They showed me a
                            level of love and affection I had never known before. They gave me medicated baths and
                            soothing oil massages, and slowly but surely, my skin started to heal. It was like magic! My
                            fur began to grow back, and before I knew it, I was looking like my old self again. I can't
                            express how grateful I am to the wonderful people at WSA. They truly saved me and gave me a
                            second chance at life. And guess what? I've been ADOPTED! I finally have a loving parent who
                            cherishes me. It's a feeling like no other. Thank you, WSA, for everything you've done for
                            me. I'll be forever grateful for your kindness and the amazing life I now have.</p>

                        <h2>Bhoomaga</h2>
                        <p>Hello there, everyone! I'm Bhoomaga, and my story begins on the streets. I was born into a
                            life where the streets were my home. I learned how to survive, searching for food and
                            enjoying the freedom to roam around town. But one fateful day, something terrible happened
                            , I won't go into the details, but I suffered a severe head
                            injury that left me feeling like my brain was exposed, with no protective layer. My head
                            started to rot, and I was lost and scared.

                            That's when We Save Animals came into my life. They rescued me from the depths of despair.
                            My head was infested with thousands of maggots, but they didn't give up on me. They removed
                            the maggots and provided the treatment I desperately needed. I didn't think I would survive,
                            but there was a glimmer of hope. Day by day, I fought to recover, and slowly but surely, I
                            started to heal. It took months of care and dedication, but here I am, back on my paws and
                            feeling like my old self again.

                             The love and compassion shown by We Save Animals, my perspective has changed. I am grateful to We
                            Save Animals for restoring my faith in humanity. They've shown me that not all humans are
                            alike, and for that, I am forever thankful.</p>
